OpenTrans
---------

This is my BSc. thesis project that aims to create a free
public transport simulator. It is based on my earlier work
created as a university project as well which served for
me as a prototype.

Requirements
------------

* Java 7
* Maven 3
* NetBeans Platform
* http://github.com/zyxist/java-utils

Structure
---------

The general mechanics is provided by ViSiToNs library which
serves as a simulation engine. Most of the code is independent
from NBP, although there are some bundles in the .nbp package
using mostly the Nodes API.

ViSiToNs provides:

* Visualization services
* Agent-based simulation engine
* Network structure representation
* Track object management

In addition, it defines the concept of transport simulation
project, and provides I/O operations that allow to read and
save the simulation state.

The actual application is written with NetBeans Platform and
contains both a network editor, and the simulation runner.

License and authors
-------------------

The software is available as a free software under the terms
of GNU Lesser General Public License 3.

The code does not contain any third party contributions,
especially from the prototype version, where other people
were also originally involved in creating it.
