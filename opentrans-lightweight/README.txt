OpenTrans
=========

OpenTrans is a public transport network simulator intended for educational purposes.
Currently it aims at simulating the vehicles, and it does not track individual
passengers at all.

In order to run OpenTrans, you need Java 7 installed on your PC. The application
has been extensively tested on Linux and OpenJDK, but should also work without
problems on other operating systems and JVM implementations.
