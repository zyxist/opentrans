/**
 * Common interface for junctions and vertices. Allows treating them as
 * the same entities by most operations. There is an important difference
 * for geometry stuff between vertices and their records. The records operate
 * on absolute units, whereas the coordinate system for {@link IVertex} objects
 * is relative towards the top-left corner of a segment. Rationale: vertices
 * must survive world size changes without problems, records are by definition
 * temporary and we can simply discard them. Although vertex records are used
 * as mementos in the history engine, this does not hurt us, because the operations
 * are atomic, so if the world size was A, B, when the network layout operation
 * was executed, then it will always be A, B during the undo/redo operations.
